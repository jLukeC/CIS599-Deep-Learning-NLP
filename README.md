# Possible Project Directions

## Toxic Comment Classification Challenge
[Identify and classify toxic online comments](https://conversationai.github.io/)

## Rasa Core UI for Interactive Training
Most of the data / training interaction with rasa is done through markdown files on the command line. It could be useful to build a UI that would allow non-coders to build up the training data (while the coders actually train the model etc). I think it owuld also be a great learning tool for people getting started with Rasa.

## Voight-Kampff Machine
An interrogation dialogue game (the name comes from Blade Runner).

[Video Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umc9ezAyJv0)
[online test (multiple choice only](http://www.bfi.org.uk/are-you-a-replicant/)
## Text / Audio only game
Look into
  - [Twisty Little Passages](https://www.amazon.com/Twisty-Little-Passages-Approach-Interactive/dp/0262633183) by Nick Motford. **A critical approach to interactive fiction, as literature and game.**
  - Alexa api
  - [Dungeons and Dragons content generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/)
  

## Image 2 Latex

This project would involve implementing a model that consumes pictures of LaTeX equations and generates the corresponding LaTeX code. My work would be based on the paper: [What You Get Is What You See: A Visual Markup Decompiler](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04938v1.pdf). This challenge is also ]a request for research from OpenAI](https://openai.com/requests-for-research/#im2latex).



## Corrective Weightlifting App

This idea has definitely been explored but with the release of [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) the technology seems to be in the right place now. We would just need a good dataset of people exercising correctly and incorrectly.
